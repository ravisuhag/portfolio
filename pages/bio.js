                <span>
                    Leading technology efforts to design and develop data interfaces for evidence
                    based policy decisions and increasing accountability in public programs.
                    We have developed high-potential pilot projects which demonstrate the value
                    of data and evidence through hands-on capacity building, while simultaneously
                    creating innovative and effective ways for policy actors to utilize data and
                    research evidence to improve their decision making.

                <h4>Consultant, Data Journalism, Hindustan Times</h4>
                <span>
                    Built the definitive online source of real-time air quality monitoring in
                    all of India for Hindustan Times. This project involved working on sensor
                    journalism, extensive web crawling for data collection and moinitoring platform
                    for data exploration. The goal of the project was to empower citizens to make
                    better decisions, and so that they can hold their government accountable.

                <span>
                    Built data exploration framework for emission trading system to enable the
                    Ministry of Environment & Forests to cap total pollution emissions in select
                    areas and increase regulatory transparency and accountability. The pilot scheme
                    provided a model for expansion within India and a framework for implementing global
                    environmental policy. This project was done in collaboration with JAPAL South Asia,
                    Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and the Tamil
                    Nadu Pollution Control Board.
