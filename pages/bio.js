                    Hi there, I am Ravi Suhag, just another creative geek. I have
                    a very curious path both personally and professionally. Since I was a
                    little boy, I've been fascinated by how we use technology and interact
                    with things. After designing embedded systems and robots for a couple
                    of years during my graduation, obtaining a degree in Electronics and
                    Communication Engineering, I decided to learn design and code on my own
                    and have been working as a UI/UX designer and full-stack developer since
                    June 2012. I am many things and hungry to learn more and be more.
