>  Hello, welcome to my little space on the web!

I am an award-winning web architect, designer, developer, maker, data journalist and entrepreneur from India. I help people build great products. I'm currently working as tech consultant at Evidence for Policy Design at the Center for International Development, Harvard University where we build tools that enable government to make data driven policy decisions.

Have fun in browsing and thank you for visiting!

## Colophon

This portfolio makes use of many great tools; tools that make my life as a developer easy and fun.

Portfolio is built with [Middleman](http://www.middlemanapp.com), an open source static site generator. It is deployed on github pages using [middleman-gh-pages](https://github.com/edgecase/middleman-gh-pages). 

The CSS is written in Sass. The font used is Open Sans, and is served via Google Fonts. The photograph on the aboutpageâ€™s masthead is of me speaking at JoshTalks.

Feel free to take a look round.

## Usage

To install dependencies: 

```
$ bundle install
