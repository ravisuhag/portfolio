A decade of turning software chaos into something beautiful. This portfolio is built the same way I approach everything else - with care, intention, and a healthy obsession with making things work better than they need to.

## What you'll find here

Stories from the trenches of building data platforms at scale. Thoughts on engineering leadership. A few projects I'm proud of. Some talks I've given. The usual suspects of a developer's digital life, but hopefully with a bit more soul.

## Under the hood

This is a Next.js app built with modern web tech that prioritizes speed and simplicity. Because life's too short for slow websites.

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

That's it. Simple as it should be.

## Why this exists

Every engineer needs a place to think out loud. This is mine. The code is on GitHub, the thoughts are everywhere, and the coffee is always brewing.

Thanks for stopping by.
