A decade of turning software chaos into something beautiful. From building data platforms that handle millions of events to leading engineering teams across continents, the journey has been about finding elegant solutions to complex problems.

This portfolio is built the same way I approach everything else - with care, intention, and a healthy obsession with making things work better than they need to.

### What you'll find here

Stories from the trenches of building data platforms at scale. Thoughts on engineering leadership. A few projects I'm proud of. Some talks I've given. The usual suspects of a developer's digital life, but hopefully with a bit more soul.

### Under the hood

This is a Next.js app built with modern web tech that prioritizes speed and simplicity. View transitions make navigation feel fluid, markdown gets transformed into beautiful content, and everything is optimized for performance. Because life's too short for slow websites.

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

That's it. Simple as it should be, powerful as it needs to be.

### Why this exists

Every engineer needs a place to think out loud. This is mineâ€”a digital laboratory where ideas evolve from scattered thoughts into structured insights. The code lives on GitHub, the experiments happen in production, and the coffee is always brewing.

It's also a way to give back to a community that taught me everything I know, one blog post and open-source contribution at a time.

Thanks for stopping by.
