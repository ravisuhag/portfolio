Hello, welcome to my little space on the web!

I am an developer, designer, maker, data journalist and entrepreneur from India. I help people build great products. I am currently working as VP Engineering at Gojek, Indonesia's largest hyper-local company. Where I lead teams to build large-scale, self-service data platforms, allowing its workforce to make data-driven decisions.

Have fun in browsing and thank you for visiting!
