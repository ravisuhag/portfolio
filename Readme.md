## Who i am ?

I am an EmCoDesignEr. Now you must be thinking what the f*** is that. Well here you go :-

EmCoDesignEr = Embedded + Code + Design + Entrepreneur or Engineer ;)

## Roadmap for the bad ass setup: 

  1. Moving to github Pages and Jekyll
  2. Using CSS Preprocessor (LESS or SASS - Still figuring out)
  3. Front End Framework -- Ummmm ok lets move to Bootstrap 3. Its Cool isn't it ?
  4. Markup -- Research it process for the best one.
  5. Integrating Behance API to display my work.
  
*And this is not it, i am gonna spend some more time in research for making this setup more bad ass. So stay tuned .. and suggest more bad thngs i can use for the project .
