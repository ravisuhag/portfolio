There’s plenty of advice floating around about building A-teams, about hiring people smarter, sharper, and more capable than you. And that advice is solid. Surrounding yourself with exceptional talent can be transformative. But what’s often left unsaid is what comes after you build that team. What does it take to keep them?

Hiring smart people isn’t the finish line. It’s the starting gun.

Because here’s the truth: You don’t buy a Ferrari and leave it in the garage. You don’t spend top dollar on performance, speed, and beauty only to let it sit idle. You buy it to hit the open road, to feel it roar, to see what it can really do.

And even if you do, guess what? It’ll still cost you the same. The insurance. The maintenance. The fuel. The care. So if you’re going to invest in something that powerful, you better make sure it’s doing what it was built for.

Smart, ambitious people are no different. They come with energy, edge, and ideas.

When you bring them on board and then give them easy problems, ignore their input, or drown them in bureaucracy, it’s the equivalent of revving that Ferrari once a month and calling it good. You’re wasting potential, and worse, you’re eroding trust.

Great talent needs great challenges. They need to wrestle with hard, meaningful problems. They need room to run, space to stretch, and leadership that listens, really listens, when they raise flags or push back on decisions. If you’re not doing that, you’re not leading. You’re managing decay.

And here’s something I’ve learned the hard way: The most dangerous moment isn’t when your smartest folks argue with you. It’s when they go quiet.

That’s not peace. That’s disengagement.

When the folks who used to challenge ideas, bring energy to meetings, or stay late to get something right suddenly go quiet, it’s not because everything’s fine. It’s because they’ve stopped believing their voice matters. That’s when the rot begins.

Leadership isn’t just about hiring the best, it’s about earning them, every single day.

So if you’ve been lucky enough to fill your team with brilliant people, do right by them. Give them problems that make them sweat. Stand beside them in the tough fights. And never let their silence become the norm. You owe them more than tasks. You owe them a mission. A mountain to climb.

You didn’t buy a Ferrari to let it gather dust.

Take it out. Push it. Trust it.

That’s what it was built for.
