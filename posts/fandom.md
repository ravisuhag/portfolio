I’ve never been the kind of person to call myself a fan of a sport, or an actor, or anyone I didn’t personally know. To me, sports were meant to be played, not watched. For a long time, watching a match felt like time wasted, a passive act that offered no real return.

But somewhere along the road, that changed.

Maybe it was the emotion, the unpredictability, or just how the story of a team unfolds like a living drama. I started watching cricket again. And over the last few years, I began supporting RCB. Quietly, consistently. Not the loudest in the room, but deeply invested.

Four years of cheering. Of disappointment. Of hope. And this year, finally, RCB won.

For a team long defined by heartbreak, it felt like redemption. A dream realized. We believed the celebration would be like nothing else. A release of years of longing. A night to remember.

But it turned out to be the saddest of them all.

People lost their lives. Some fans went out to celebrate and never made it back home. What should’ve been the happiest night in the team’s history became a moment of mourning.

And it made me reflect. While my views on fandom had evolved, I still struggle with the darker sides of it. The trolling. The blind defense of players we don’t know. The hate. The chaos. The dangerous obsession that plays out on our screens every day. Somewhere along the way, the love for the game became a license to fight, mock, and even endanger others. We’ve confused loyalty with aggression. We’ve let passion become reckless.

In the world of sports, wins and losses come and go. Trophies gather dust. Stats fade from memory. But what happened this time, this will stay. It is now part of RCB’s legacy.

And legacies are a choice.

There’s nothing we can do to bring back the lives lost. Next season will come, as it always does. The stadiums will fill, the jerseys will be worn with pride, and the chants will rise again. But something will be different. Something will linger in the air, unspoken but deeply felt.

This time, we carry more than just hope. We carry memory.

RCB has an opportunity to make that memory visible. Not through grand gestures, but through quiet conviction. Through the way they play. Through the way they lead. Every match can be a moment to honor those who aren’t here to witness it. Not as a ritual, but as a responsibility.

Let this not be the kind of tragedy we move on from. Let it be the kind that changes how we show up for the game, for each other, for what truly matters.

Because the real spirit of sport isn’t just in the winning. It’s in how we carry our losses. And who we choose to remember.
